Reflection – Tester 2

In this part I implemented the CustomerOrder module. The main challenge for me 
was handling the dynamic memory correctly, especially the array of Item pointers 
and making sure nothing leaks. I also had to get used to disabling the copy 
constructor and only supporting move semantics, which took a bit of testing 
until I got it right.

Another thing that needed attention was the formatting of the display() function 
and the exact output messages in fillItem(), because the tester is very strict 
about spacing and wording. After a few runs I matched the sample output.

Overall this part helped me understand move semantics and memory management 
better, and everything worked correctly when I tested it on both Visual Studio 
and on matrix.
